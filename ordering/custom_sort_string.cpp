/** Custom Sort String
 *
 * @reference   https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/
 *
 * order and str are strings composed of lowercase letters. In order, no letter occurs
 * more than once. order was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute
 * the characters of str so that they match the order that order was sorted. More
 * specifically, if x occurs before y in order, then x should occur before y in the
 * returned string. Return any permutation of str (as a string) that satisfies this
 * property.
 *  order has length at most 26, and no character is repeated in order.
 *  str has length at most 200.
 *  order and str consist of lowercase letters only.
