 * at a time. You are given a string keysPressed of length n, where keysPressed[i] was
 * the ith key pressed in the testing sequence, and a sorted list releaseTimes, where
 * releaseTimes[i] was the time the ith key was released. Both arrays are 0-indexed. The
 * 0th key was pressed at the time 0, and every subsequent key was pressed at the exact
 * time the previous key was released. The tester wants to know the key of the keypress
 * that had the longest duration. The ith keypress had a duration of
 * releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1], and the 0th keypress had a duration of
 * releaseTimes[0]. Note that the same key could have been pressed multiple times during
 * the test, and these multiple presses of the same key may not have had the same
 * duration. Return the key of the keypress that had the longest duration. If there are
 * multiple such keypresses, return the lexicographically largest key of the keypresses.

 * An array A is larger than some array B if for the first index i where A[i] != B[i],
 * A[i] > B[i].
 * For example, consider 0-indexing:
 *  [1,3,2,4] > [1,2,2,4], since at index 1, 3 > 2.
 *  [1,4,4,4] < [2,1,1,1], since at index 0, 1 < 2.
 * A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.
 * Given an integer array nums of distinct integers, return the largest subarray of nums
 * of length k.
 * All the integers of nums are unique.
 * Follow up: What if the integers in nums are not distinct?
