 *
 * A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last,
 * is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. See the following examples.
 * A node is ‘Full Node’ if both left and right children are not empty (or not NULL).
 * The approach is to do a level order traversal starting from the root. In the traversal,
 * once a node is found which is NOT a Full Node, all the following nodes must be leaf nodes.
