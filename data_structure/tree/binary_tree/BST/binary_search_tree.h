 *
 * Binary Search Tree, is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
 *  The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
 *  The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
 *  The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
 *  There must be no duplicate nodes.
