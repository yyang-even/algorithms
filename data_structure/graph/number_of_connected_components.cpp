 * Show that we can use a depth-first search of an undirected graph G to identify the connected
 * components of G, and that the depth-first forest contains as many trees as G has connected
 * components. More precisely, show how to modify depth-first search so that it assigns to each
 * vertex v an integer label v.cc between 1 and k, where k is the number of connected components
 * of G, such that u.cc = v.cc if and only if u and v are in the same connected component.
