 * A pair of newly born rabbits, male and female, were placed in a hutch. In two months these rabbits
 * began their breeding cycle and produced one pair of rabbits, one male and one female. The original
 * rabbits and their offspring continued to breed in their manner, that is, the first pair of
 * offspring appearing at the parental age of two months and then a new pair every month thereafter
 * ------ always one male and one female. All rabbits survived the first year.
 *  What then is the total number of pairs of rabbits at the beginning of each month during the first
 *  year?
