 * The greatest common divisor of two integers m and n is the largest integer that divides them both.
 * How is Extended Algorithm Useful?
 * The extended Euclidean algorithm is particularly useful when a and b are coprime (or gcd is 1).
 * Since x is the modular multiplicative inverse of “a modulo b”, and y is the modular multiplicative
 * inverse of “b modulo a”. In particular, the computation of the modular multiplicative inverse is
 * an essential step in RSA public-key encryption method.
