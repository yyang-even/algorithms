 * Given a number n, write an efficient function to print all prime factors of n.
 * For example, if the input number is 12, then output should be "2 2 3".
 * And if the input number is 315, then output should be "3 3 5 7".
 *
 * Following are the steps to find all prime factors.
 * 1) While n is divisible by 2, print 2 and divide n by 2.
 * 2) After step 1, n must be odd. Now start a loop from i = 3 to square root of n.
 * While i divides n, print i and divide n by i, increment i by 2 and continue.
 * 3) If n is a prime number and is greater than 2, then n will not become 1 by above two steps.
 * So print n if it is greater than 2.
