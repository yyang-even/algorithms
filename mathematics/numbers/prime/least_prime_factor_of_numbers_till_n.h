/** Least prime factor of numbers till n
 *
 * @reference   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/least-prime-factor-of-numbers-till-n/
 *
 * Given a number n, print least prime factors of all numbers from 1 to n. The least
 * prime factor of an integer n is the smallest prime number that divides the number.
 * The least prime factor of all even numbers is 2. A prime number is its own least
 * prime factor (as well as its own greatest prime factor).
 * Note: We need to print 1 for 1.
